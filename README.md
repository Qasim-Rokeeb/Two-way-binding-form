# Day 4 - Two-Way Binding Form ✍️

This is Day 4 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey. The focus of this project is to:

- Practice **two-way data binding** using `useState`
- Understand **lifting state up** for shared data between components
- Build a form that updates a greeting in real-time as the user types

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

✅ How to control form input state with `useState`  
✅ How to lift state to a parent component  
✅ Passing state + updater function as props  
✅ Conditional rendering of dynamic greetings  
✅ Clean form UI using Tailwind CSS

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- React (JavaScript)
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
